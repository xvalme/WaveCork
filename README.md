### WaveCork - VNA

The reports, and data extraction made with the designed VNA is in this repository. This work is mostly been made since October 2023,
for the "BII" scholarship of the VNA sub-project for the WaveCork project at INESC TEC.

Code for handling the spectrum analyzer at the INESC TEC lab, as well as a very interesting (and expensive) power supply is also here.
